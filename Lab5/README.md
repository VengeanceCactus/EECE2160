# Lab 5 Andrew Ricci

### Features of OOP in This Lab

In this lab, we make use of all four features of Object Oriented Programming. 

The first is encapsulation. This allows us to contain many function within one class, and instantiate that class when we need to access a particular function. We use this in our main functions, where we instantiate a particular class when we want to use it.

The second is abstraction. This is closely related to encapsulation, and essentially allows us as programmers to hide unnecessary information from users. This way, a user only sees exactly what they need to access. We use this in the process of separating our functions into individual classes and files.

The third is inheritance. Inheritance allows us to give one class features or permissions that mirror another class, without having to type them out again. We use this in our wiimote classes in behavior and led in which they take features from other classes.

The fourth is polymorphism. This allows us to create multiple functions with the same name, and choose between them either during runtime or compile-time. These are called overriding and overloading respectively. I did not use polymorphism in this lab to my knowledge.

### Extra Credit Definitions

Single responsibility principle: This is centered around one function per class and one class per file. It is not specific to C++, it is a principle that in order for code to be easily maintainable and adaptable, the functions must be separated from each other.

Open close principle: The open close principle dictates that certain code should be open to extension, but not open to modification of its core functions.

Bridge pattern: The bridge pattern is centered around the separation of the abstraction and the implementation stages of the code. Much like the SRP, this is focused on separating responsibilities.

Strategy pattern: This concept is based on encapsulating algorithms, and then using any of them in a singular representation.

Dependency injection: Dependency injection centers around a piece of code passing features to a client directly, rather than them being accessed by the client.
